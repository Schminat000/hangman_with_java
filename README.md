# Overview

The software created was to learn the basics of programming with Java in VSCode. I created a very basic hangman game!


The reason I did this was to learn the basics of Java and get more comfortable with it. I know Java is a base for most programming languages so I thought it might be useful to learn! I know at Riot Games, they use a lot of Java. This really motivated me to want to learn how to use Java and make my own little game. I hope you see/appreciate the words added within the game!

# Development Environment

I used Visual Studo Code to compile all the code.

* Visual Studio Code
* Java / Java Package
* Git / GitHub
* Java Scanner / ArrayList

# Useful Websites

* [Oracle - Java (JDK Download)](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/)
* [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/java/default.asp)
* [GitHub](https://github.com)
* [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)

# Future Work

* Next time I do this, I would like to make the iconic hangman art to go along with the game.
* Before I added the try and finally statements, my scanner was having a resource leak. It took me a little bit of time to figure out try and finally statements so  I could close the leak. Next time I want to play with those more to understand them better.
* I really need to practice better and more informative commenting throughout the code.
